UPS (UPDATE PER SECOND):
Takes care of logic (playermove, event, etc)
Same on all PCs
in case there is lag, there is a way to catch up

FPS (FRAME PER SECOND):
Draws the gamescene (the level, player, enemies, etc)
Can be changed

Reasons to separate the two:
    Easier to read the code
    Can sacrifice some frames to save the Updates
    Can set different FPS for different systems
